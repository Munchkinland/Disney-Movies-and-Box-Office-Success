## Disney Movies Analysis Project 🎬✨

Welcome to the thrilling world of Disney Movies! 🌟 In this project, we embark on an enchanting journey to uncover the magic behind Disney's cinematic universe. Buckle up as we dive into the data, explore fascinating insights, and even build a predictive model to forecast movie success. 🚀🔮

Data Exploration and Fusion 📊🧩
Let's start by unlocking the treasure trove of Disney movies datasets. We'll introduce you to the enchanting realms of voice actors, directors, revenues, and more. Get ready to witness the first glimpses of these captivating datasets, each holding a piece of the Disney storytelling puzzle. 🎭📚

Unifying the Kingdom 🏰🤝
Our mission? To ensure data harmony across different datasets. We'll normalize movie titles, cross-check common titles, and merge datasets seamlessly. The result? A consolidated dataset that weaves together the tales of voice actors, directors, and the total gross revenue. 🌐👑

Preparing for the Grand Regression Adventure 🚀📈
Before we embark on our modeling quest, we need to prepare our data. Our trusty wand (code) will handle missing values, transform data, and eliminate duplicates. The dataset emerges polished and ready for regression magic! ✨💻

Charting the Unknown with EDA 🌌🔍
Time to cast a spell of Exploratory Data Analysis! Marvel at visualizations revealing the distribution of revenue, genre-based earnings, and the magical journey of total revenue through time. The 90s reveal their secrets as we zoom in on the revenue peaks. 📉📈

Characters, Genres, and Directors - Oh My! 🎭🎥
Univariate analysis unfolds, showcasing the variety in genres, MPAA ratings, and the distribution of revenue. Top characters, voice actors, and directors take the stage, each contributing to the rich tapestry of Disney movies. 🌈🎬

Multivariate Marvels 🎭📊
The multivariate spectacle begins! Watch as we unravel relationships between variables, exploring revenue across genres and MPAA ratings, analyzing the impact of top directors, and uncovering the intricate dance between total and inflation-adjusted revenue. 🤹‍♂️📊

Contingency Tables - A Categorical Adventure 🕵️‍♂️📊
Contingency tables provide a map of relationships between categorical variables. Traverse the landscapes of genre-MPAA ratings, character-voice actor pairs, director-genre alliances, and witness the dance of MPAA ratings and release years. 🗺️🔄

The Correlation Conundrum 🤔🔄
Our magical mirror, the correlation matrix, reflects the interplay between numerical variables. Discover potential connections and correlations that add depth to our understanding. 🔄📈

Regression Modeling with TPOT - Predicting the Future 🔮🚀
The climax approaches! A regression model, guided by the wizardry of TPOT, takes center stage. Watch as the model learns from the past to predict future success. The best pipeline is unveiled, setting the stage for forecasting Disney's cinematic destiny. 🧙‍♂️🎯

Model Export - Saving the Magic 📥💾
The magic is captured! Our best regression pipeline is saved for future adventures. A Python script (best_pipeline_for_regression.py) and a joblib file (model_pipeline.pkl) become the keys to unlock predictive insights. 🗝️✨

This README is your gateway to the Disney Movies Analysis adventure. Dive into the scripts and notebooks to uncover even more wonders. The magic of Disney movies awaits! 🎬✨
